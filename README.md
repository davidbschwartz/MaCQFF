# MaCQFF

This repository contains the code for my semester project on "Approximation Techniques for Multi-Agent Coverage Control". The main contributions of the practical side of this work are the implementation and integration of quadrature Fourier features (QFF) by Mutny & Krause ([paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/hash/4e5046fc8d6a97d18a5f54beaed54dea-Abstract.html), [code](https://github.com/Mojusko/QFF)) and the Stochastic Greedy algorithm for submodular function maximization by Mirzasoleiman at al. ([paper](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/files/mirzasoleiman15lazier.pdf)) into the multi-agent learning algorithms for (safe) coverage control by Prajapat et al. ([paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/60dc26558762425a465cb0409fc3dc52-Paper-Conference.pdf), [code](https://github.com/manish-pra/SafeMaC)).

We call the adapted, more scalable version of the multi-agent learning algorithm "MaCQFF".
